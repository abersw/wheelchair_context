/*
 * detected_objects_context.cpp
 * wheelchair_context
 * version: 0.0.1 Majestic Maidenhair
 * Status: Pre-Alpha
 * 
 * Goal for this software:
 * add same calculation software
 * object weighting = maximum weighting value (100%) / times trained (by user)
 * object weighting is capped at 0 and 100%
 * object uniqueness = maximum uniqueness (100%) / instances
 * 
 * notes for calculating uniqueness
 * uniqueness is percentage
 * if you have two rooms and it is located in 1, it's a unique item
 * occurances divided by total rooms
 *  1 / 2 = 0.5 * 100 = 50 - 50% common
 *  2 / 3 = 0.6667 * 100 = 66.66  |  100 - 66.6 = 33.34
 * what about rooms which haven't been trained as extensively? What affect does that have on uniqueness?

 * Now we have the number of objects within the room..., so we can take this into consideration
 * 
 * On second thought all this stuff above could go in the navigation node - as it's part of the decision making process
 * 
 * This needs an input from the user - this is the kitchen
 * Detected objects will then be allocated a room
